        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a dusky evening, when the sky was covered with blue, a man walked by the side of a lonely road bing serious about 
        something. It seemed like he wanted to meet a person called Mr. Adan Grey and discuss about something. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Hello there! Robert! How are you?" Adan Grey asked. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I am doing good Mr. Adan! How do you do?" he asked. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I am doing well. What's up this way?" Adan asked him. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robert said, "I have a long desire to write a story. I have written many stories in my life based on both fantasy and real life 
        experiences and I am satisfied with them all. But, still I want to write one particular story. But, I don't know where to start
        it." <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "What a shock? A novelist have come seeking an idea for a novel? You have written lots of stories in you life and I have read 
        them all and I also know about you and your writings. But, I am surprised that you have come to meet me to ask idea for your novel. Is it really you?"
        Adan asked. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Who came in seek of the concept of the story? I need help in the way to bring the story up. It is not about the story or content
        or message delivered by the story. It is about the techniques used in that story. I need help for that." Robert replied. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I can't understand." Adan said. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I need a story that is written in simple English which is easy to understand. But, the concept should be mature. 
        The story can be of any topic. But, some things should be noted down while writing it. The things to be noted are, 
        the story should have a hero, heroine, villian and an antihero. This should be one of the best stories written ever in the concept of antihero." 
        I said. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I see! So, your story should have an antihero. That is why you need help." Adan said. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Moreover, some things to be noted while writing the story. The story should include Portmanteau words like brunch, spork, frenemy." I said. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adan thought for a while and replied, "I am there to help you build the story." <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adan refered multiple books and collected information about stories based on antihero concept. 
        He gathered information like 'Who is an antihero?', 'What will he do?', 'What is the role of an antihero in a story?' and more. Then, they created a good story on the concept. <br>
