		I have wondered in many instances of my life. One can be a 
		professional web developer in his life and can use different 
		technologies to develop a website. He may use different 
		technologies like, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Javascript 
		frameworks like Angular, Vue and Javascript libraries like 
		React JS, Three JS, D3 JS, whatever.
	</p>
	<p style="color: white;">
		But, still, designing in HTML using inline CSS without the use of 
		Javascript, and giving solid background colours like "aqua", 
		"blue", "green", "yellow", "pink" without using hexadecimal 
		values like, "#0000ff", "#00ff00" and all, on the notepad and 
		seeing its output makes my mind more relaxed than working with Javascript
		libraries.
	</p>
	<p style="color: white">
		This is how I used to develop webpages a few years back. And now, I am
		rewinding my time back once again.
