			<h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p>I started my journey in literature during my school days, when I was very young, at the age of twelve. The first poem that I wrote was "Trees and the Nature" for which I was remarked by my school principal. Starting from small 
			achievements, I grew up slowly. I started writing poems on various topics from which I created my first poem collection in my later years. I was born in Madurai, Tamilnadu, India on August 04, 2025 in a Telugu Hindu family. 
			Our family belongs to Naidu community who speak Telugu, but for me, personally, I am passionate in Tamil rather than Telugu. For that reason, I have contibuted as much as I can for Tamil literature. 
			So far, I have written around 40 poems and lyrics in Tamil.
			<br><br>
			My mother, Mrs. Sukanya is a computer science lecturer and my father's Mr. Ramesh babu is a mechanical engineer in TNEB. In my life, I have changed oaround 5 school from my kindergarden till higher secondaries. 
			The very first school where I studied was Sabari Nursery and Primary School, Chennai. Then I changed to Pon Vidhyashram in Chennai and then, Apple Perks International School in Mettur, Salem. Then I changed to
			Mahatma Global Gateway School in Madurai and finally,
			I completed my schooling in Mahatma Montessori School (Also called Mahatma Baba School) in Surveyor Colony, Madurai.
			I earned my bachelor's degree from S.A. Engineering College, Chennai in the field of Computer Science and Engineering. 
			</p>
			<h2>Awards and Recognition</h2>
			<p>To be honest, from my childhood, I have not awared for any great achievements, but still my desire to succeed is not extinguished in my heart. I have contributed to Tamil and English literature as much as I can 
			by writing poems, short stories, plays and novels. 
			</p>
			<h2>Personal Life</h2>
			<p>I am the only son in my family, born after a great struggle. At the time of my birth, I didn't breathe, but thanks to the efforts of my parents and medical team, my life was saved. I owe a special debt of 
			gratitude to Dr. J. Sundhara Pandiyan, a pediatrician at Padma Specialty Clinic in Madurai, who played a crucial role in saving my life. I was born at 1:19 am on August 4, 2005. From a young age, 
			I faced numerous health challenges, particularly with my brain and urinary system. As a result, I encountered many difficulties and struggles. The elders in my life took extra care of me, but unfortunately, my friends didn't 
			show the same concern. Due to my health issues, I often spent my school days alone, rather than socializing with my peers. Many didn't approach me, possibly because I seemed different. However, I was aware of my creative potential. 
			My mind had a unique ability to visualize and create. This realization dawned on me at the age of 12 when I wrote my first poem, unlocking a newfound appreciation for my imagination. As I progressed, I began writing plays and novels. 
			However, when I entered eleventh grade, most of my subjects changed, and I missed Social Science, a subject I had previously loved. As a history enthusiast, I felt disengaged during my higher secondary schooling due to packed 
			schedules and lack of interest. In twelfth grade, my health issues hindered my studies, resulting in an average score of 67% across all subjects. Despite this, I persisted and focused on nurturing my writing talents, crafting poems 
			and stories. This marked a turning point. When I entered college, I discovered a new world. The Bridge Course, a week-long program, helped me transition to college life and introduced me to various subjects, including Universal Human Values, 
			which resonated deeply with me. "During the Bridge Course, I actively participated, answering all questions confidently, which earned me recognition in my department. For the first time, I experienced the true meaning of friendship and camaraderie. 
			Until then, I had led a solitary life, but suddenly I was part of a group. In literature classes, I showcased my poetry skills and received praise from my lecturer. Those were indeed memorable days in college. 
			However, after the Bridge Course ended, the atmosphere shifted to a more serious academic focus, with studies taking center stage. Gradually, my interests shifted from history and literature to web designing. 
			A friend approached me to create a website, and I drew upon my basic HTML knowledge from my 12th year. Although my expertise was limited, I had experimented with simple websites back then. Using HTML and inline CSS, 
			I built a restaurant website for my friend. He was impressed, and this project sparked a transformation in me. My creative energy began to lean towards web design, and I started focusing on building more websites. Despite this shift, 
			my work remained private, with neither my websites nor poems shared publicly. I was eager to showcase my websites to a broader audience, but struggled to reach beyond my family. That changed when I discovered LinkedIn in my second year, 
			thanks to a college staff member. I started posting my websites as videos, which yielded positive results – many people were impressed by my skills and began following and connecting with me. This momentum encouraged me to create more websites, 
			web-based games, and posters using HTML. Around the same time, I learned about UI/UX design from a college alumnus, which sparked my interest. Despite initial difficulties finding resources online, I was determined to learn. Fortunately, 
			my college offered a value-added course on UI/UX design, which introduced me to no-code website and mobile app development. I mastered Figma, a tool that simplified mobile app creation. My journey transformed significantly in my second year, 
			shifting from history to literature, then web design, and finally UI/UX design. I continued to push forward, diving deeper into computer science and exploring new concepts. I drew inspiration from electronics, creating website simulations of 
			electronic devices. One notable project was a digital flip-flop simulator, which brought computer hardware concepts to life online. I also developed websites showcasing algorithms in data science. Although these projects were not known by many people, 
			they demonstrated my dedication to learning and innovation. Next, I sought to share my creations – books, poems, websites, and games – with a wider audience. To achieve this, I learned about deployment and mastered deploying sites on GitHub. 
			Initially, it was challenging, but with practice, I became proficient. I've made some of my websites accessible via GitHub. I request that you explore these resources, read my poems and stories, and make use of them if you find them valuable.
			The URL of all my websites are given in this site. Please make use of them.</p>
